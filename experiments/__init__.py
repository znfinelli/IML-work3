"""
Experiments Package.

This package contains the runner scripts for the three main experiment sessions
required by the project.

Sessions
--------
- Session 1: Standard Clustering (Agglomerative, GMM).
- Session 2: Improved K-Means & Fuzzy Clustering.
- Session 3: Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) + Clustering.

# Note: These are typically run as __main__ scripts, but exposing them
# allows main.py to import and run them programmatically.
